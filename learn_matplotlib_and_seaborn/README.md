# Baseline Graphing Functions for various line plots
I've included 3 simple functions, each in separate files, that can easily be customized along with some sample data.

# Requirements
Python 3, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

# Instructions
* Simply run `python <filename>.py` in the terminal and wait for the plots to appear. Close the plot window to exit.
* To change the appearance of the graphs, write you code in the functions and before the `plt.show()` line inside the file you want to change (each file makes a different graph)

*Note if you have both Python 2 and 3 on your machine, the command above becomes `python3 <filename>.py`*
